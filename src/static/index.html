            <h3>A Site by Mariano Hernandez</h3>
            <div>Thank you for visiting my personal space in this digital ocean. Initially this site was built to showcase my work in going through a series of certifications from <a href="http://www.freeCodeCamp.org">Free Code Camp</a>. In the future I hope to also share little of my experience on topics of engineering, design, leadership, and my journy as I investigate new languages and technologies. I invite you to explore these pages and hope you will learn something new for yourself. It may be interesting for you to view from multiple devices so you can get a full perspective of the Responsive nature of this site. If anything I've done makes you wonder "how'd he do that?" please do reach out and ask, and again thank you for visiting.

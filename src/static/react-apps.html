                    This was the first project for the Front End Libraries certification. The work is pretty simple. I elected not to use Redux for any state management. The most difficult part was recalling how to use jQuery to make async API calls. I did not use any promises or async/awaits in this project (that came later). I also began to stratch the surface with Bootstrap though not to any significant degree.
                </p>
                <p>
                	Because of the simplicity of the project I spent more time in styling and discovering different ways to manage that styling. In my original project I used react state to update the style elements individually to change the theme color. In later projects I adopted a different approach of using CSS variables and classes to represent theme settings and use the React state to change to different theme classes in the parent container. This has the benefit of not having to modify style in multiple locations.

                <p>
                    This was my second project along the road to Front End Library certification. My understanding of React was expanded greatly in this project and it's where I built my first reusable component with my Windowing capabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initially I just used the React state management for most of the interactivity, but re-engineered the project to use Redux after the Drum Machine project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most interesting parts of the project actually came during the re-engineering effort. It was during this period that I extracted out the expand/shrink fucntions out of CSS and moved it into the Redux state machine cycle. I had the idea that I could dispatch an event on one window that all windows would observe, then pass a state object that either expands the window or hides the window (when maximizing), or puts all the windows back to the orignial state.
                </p>
                <pre><code>WindowComponent = connect(
  function mapStateToProps(state, ownProps){

    let fullSize = state.windows[ownProps.id].fullSize;
    let styleClass = "";

    if(!state.windows.fullSize){
      styleClass = "window col-md-" + state.windows[ownProps.id].width
    }else{
      if(fullSize){
        styleClass = "window col-md-12"
      }else{
        styleClass = "window windowHide"
      }
    }

    let toReturn = {
      width: state.windows[ownProps.id].width,
      fullSize: fullSize,
      styleClass: styleClass
    }
    return toReturn
  },
  function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch){
    return{
      resizeWindow: (id, width) => {
        dispatch(createResizeAction(id, width))
      }
    }
  }, null,  {forwardRef: true}
)(WindowComponent)

                    At this point I still hadn't implented any state managment with Redux. I struggled to understand the API and the information within the course work was so bare bones that it really just pointed in a direction and expected me to go and do further research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I set about to pick up the pieces I had been ignoring in the previsous projects. It was in this phase when the API finally clicked for me. I think it finally clicked for me when I was reading on Higher Order Compoents (HOC) as it relates to currying and all of a sudden the React.Component.connect method made sense to me. It was the result of this that I was able to use the connect method to create HOCs that I could configure through the state object. Below is an example of one such HOC.
                </p>
                <pre><code>
const TimingButton = (props)=>{
  let className = "fa-"+props.label+"-circle"
  return(
    <button className="button lengthButton " 
      id={props.name} 
      disabled={props.timing} 
      onClick={props.action}>
      <i className={"fas " + className}></i>
    </button>
  )}; 

const SessionDecrementButton = connect(
  state =>({timing: state.timing, label: "minus"}),
  dispatch => ({action: () =>  { dispatch({type:DEC_SESSION})}})
)(TimingButton)

const SessionIncrementButton = connect(
  state =>({timing: state.timing, label: "plus"}),
  dispatch => ({action: () =>  { dispatch({type:INC_SESSION})}})
)(TimingButton)

</code></pre>
                <p>
                    As you can see the TimingButton is wrapped by the HOC generated by the connect function which ties a specific dispatch to the clicking of the button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    as well as optimizing the my Component connections to Redux to minimize component updates.

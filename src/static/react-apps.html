			<p>This was the first project for the Front End Libraries certification. The work is pretty simple. I only had to find an API that was accessable over CORS. I elected not to use Redux for any state management. </p>
			<p>As first projects go, the experience was good. I had a bit of work figuring out how to use jQuery to do an async api call. I never did get into promises, which is work for future projects. I also began to stratch the surface with Bootstrap though not to any significant degree. </p>
			<p>What follows is the first Mixin I wrote. It's very basic and I find that I don't use it anymore, probably because I've not had any problems with border raidus across browsers yet. </p>
			<pre><code>
@mixin border-radius($x){ 
  -webkit-border-radius: $x;
  -moz-border-radius: $x;
  -ms-border-radius: $x;
  border-radius: $x;
}

</code></pre>
  			<p>The technology list employed in this project includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>HTML5</li>
				<li>CSS and SCSS</li>
				<li>ES6</li>
				<li>React</li>
			</ul>

			<p>This was my second project along the road to Front End Library certification. My understanding of React was expanded greatly in this project and it's where I built my first reusable component with my Windowing capabilities. </p>
			<p>Initially I just used the React state management for most of the interactivity, but re-engineered the project to use Redux after the Drum Machine project. </p>	
			<p>The most interesting parts of the project actually came during the re-engineering effort. It was during this period that I extracted out the expand/shrink fucntions out of CSS and moved it into the Redux state machine cycle. I had the idea that I could dispatch an event on one window that all windows would observe, then pass a state object that either expands the window or hides the window (when maximizing), or puts all the windows back to the orignial state. </p>
			<pre><code>WindowComponent = connect(
  function mapStateToProps(state, ownProps){

    let fullSize = state.windows[ownProps.id].fullSize;
    let styleClass = "";

    if(!state.windows.fullSize){
      styleClass = "window col-md-" + state.windows[ownProps.id].width
    }else{
      if(fullSize){
        styleClass = "window col-md-12"
      }else{
        styleClass = "window windowHide"
      }
    }

    let toReturn = {
      width: state.windows[ownProps.id].width,
      fullSize: fullSize,
      styleClass: styleClass
    }
    return toReturn
  },
  function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch){
    return{
      resizeWindow: (id, width) => {
        dispatch(createResizeAction(id, width))
      }
    }
  }, null,  {forwardRef: true}
)(WindowComponent)

			<p>At this point I still hadn't implented any state managment with Redux. I struggled to understand the API and the information within the course work was so bare bones that it really just pointed in a direction and expected me to go and do further research. </p>
			<p>I set about to pick up the pieces I had been ignoring in the previsous projects. It was in this phase when the API finally clicked for me. I think it finally clicked for me when I was reading on Higher Order Compoents (HOC) as it relates to currying and all of a sudden the React.Component.connect method made sense to me. It was the result of this that I was able to use the connect method to create HOCs that I could configure through the state object. Below is an example of one such HOC. </p>
			<pre><code>
const TimingButton = (props)=>{
  let className = "fa-"+props.label+"-circle"
  return(
    &lt;button className="button lengthButton " 
      id={props.name} 
      disabled={props.timing} 
      onClick={props.action}&gt;
      &lt;i className={"fas " + className}&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;/button&gt;
  )}; 

const SessionDecrementButton = connect(
  state =>({timing: state.timing, label: "minus"}),
  dispatch => ({action: () =>  { dispatch({type:DEC_SESSION})}})
)(TimingButton)

const SessionIncrementButton = connect(
  state =>({timing: state.timing, label: "plus"}),
  dispatch => ({action: () =>  { dispatch({type:INC_SESSION})}})
)(TimingButton)

</code></pre>
			<p>As you can see the TimingButton is wrapped by the HOC generated by the connect function which ties a specific dispatch to the clicking of the button. </p>
			<p>as well as optimizing the my Component connections to Redux to minimize component updates.  </p>

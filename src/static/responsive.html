                <p>
                    The following are details outlying the final projects for the Front End Libraries <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc4893b047-b5d0-472e-b76e-3805d9ed0aba/front-end-libraries">certification</a> from <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp.org</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The specific libraries covered in the course work include HTML/HTML5, CSS, Applied Visual Design, Accessibility, a few Web Design Principles and Flexbox/Grid. Original projects are available as Pens on <a href="http://www.codepen.com">CodePen.com</a> and include the certification tests used to validate each project. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of doing Responsive Mobile First design, I learned the most out of these projects, though not strictly as a result of the coursework's certification process. Because of the nature of Free Code Camp I found its possible to game some of the certifications tests. However, this course has particularly weak testing abilities and each project can be passed with little to no real work being done. I would caution any hiring manager's to be skeptical of anyone presenting this certification and ask to see specific work examples.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    As a final note I chose to go back and obtain this certification in the interest of completion. As such many of the projects I completed simply to satisfy the test cases and not to create the best representation of each project. This is particularly noticeable in the Tribute page and the Product Landing page. That said, I more than made up for that by focusing my work in the Portfolio page which serves as the basis of the home page for this site, and the Technical Documentation which serves as the basis for this page and the Front End certification pages on this site.

                    This project is a simple form just with the objective of styling most of the standard form components. It doesn't do anything. I spent most of my time on this one tyring to figure out how to put a background image and an overlay on top of it while still allowing the primary form to be slightly opaque to view the image through the background.

                    The page you are reading, as well as the <a href="/view/react-apps">React Apps</a> are decended from the origianl Technical Documentation project. In the original I designed the navigation tool to display as a scollable area at the top of the screen in mobile devices. I never was very satisfied with that design, so for these pages I rebuilt the naviagation as a drawer in smaller viewports. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have very minimal JS that opens/closes the drawer. The JS The obvious event hook was on the drawer's onclick, but I also added two hooks to the click on the main body and touching a link. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My only gotcha came as a result of managing the left location of the drawer by both CSS (via media queries) and Javascript (via events). Turns out if one sets a style in Javascript CSS considers it to be an inline style and it will always override any styling that might be driven by CSS media queries. To compensate for this I removed any inline styling on resizing events to allow the CSS Media Queries to regain control.
